// pfm takes over a host-level surface here: `set-titles on` plus its own

// before tmux starts keeps it only while `set-titles off` stands, so a
// framework that flips it must at minimum record that it did — otherwise the
// next reader cannot tell "pfm owns this" from "the host owns this and pfm has
// not stomped it yet", and reads a deliberate setting as drift. That
// misreading is exactly how eight live servers had their tab badges destroyed
// by a well-meaning fix.
//
// Both states are legitimate — INFO, never a warning — ONLY when a server's
// actual ownership matches what the config key intends. When it does not, the
// line says so explicitly as a DIVERGENCE and the summary counts it: a server
// left behind by a policy change, or by a scheduler outage that never reached
// it, is not a deliberate opt-out, and reporting it as one is exactly how five
// live servers went unnoticed for weeks with the wrong OSC title never
// emitted at all.
