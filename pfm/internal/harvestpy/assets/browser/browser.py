"""Opt-in real-browser rung worker: Patchright + system Chrome.

Ported near-verbatim from the retired Python harvester's browser rung
(`git show fac3319:harvester/src/harvester/net.py` L593-672). The rung never
solves anything interactive (no Turnstile/CAPTCHA solver); it passes PASSIVE
bot walls by rendering in a real Chrome whose CDP automation handshake is
hidden by Patchright.

Protocol (JSON lines over stdin/stdout), one request serialized at a time:

  Go -> worker:   {"op":"fetch","url":"https://…","proxy":"http://…|null","headless":true,
                   "host_resolver_rules":"MAP host 1.2.3.4"|null,"timeout_ms":45000}
                  {"op":"smoke"}
  worker -> Go:   zero or more guard asks before the final line:
                  {"ask":"fetchable","url":"https://…"}
  Go -> worker:   {"allow":true}
                  {"allow":false,"reason":"refusing private/internal host …"}
  worker -> Go:   exactly one final line:
                  {"ok":true,"html":"…","status":403,"headless":false}
                  {"ok":false,"error":"patchright not installed"}

SSRF: Go owns the fetchable decision (harvest.AssertFetchable) — the route
guard below ASKS for every URL Chrome touches (initial navigation, every
redirect, every subresource, every XHR via context.route("**/*", …)) and
aborts blocked targets BEFORE Chrome ever connects.
