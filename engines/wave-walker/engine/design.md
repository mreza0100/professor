# Wave Walker Engine — Design

How the engine works and why it is shaped this way. The source of truth is `src/` plus its tests. `dist/workflow.js` is the immutable legacy production bundle; new builds land beside it under `dist/cross-workflow/` and never overwrite it. Numbers quoted here explain design decisions — `src/config.ts` is the authoritative table for every default.

## What this is

A multi-agent verification engine that runs as a Claude Code **Workflow script**: one flat JS file, executed in a sandbox whose only APIs are `agent()/parallel()/pipeline()/log()/phase()` plus plain JavaScript — no filesystem, no Node builtins, no module loader. The engine walks a wave's diff after merge (or a branch before merge), fact-checks claim sets, and runs goal-driven code investigations. Its callers are the `wave/walker.md` command and the wave orchestration family; the caller passes everything project-specific at runtime (see [The project profile](#the-project-profile)), which is why one built bundle serves every project.

## Design principles

1. **The judge is never the thing being judged.** Every verdict is produced by a seat that did not produce the evidence: sensors extract cards, a zero-token rule engine diffs them, judges adjudicate only flagged anomalies, an independent final judge rules the whole walk and may overturn any of them. Where two seats disagree about the same file, the disagreement is escalated by name — never averaged (`computeVerdictContradictions`).
2. **Coverage is stated, never implied.** Every lens reports its denominator: the security merge names every unswept file, the sensor cap names every dropped field (`unsensedFields`), gate machinery that did not run says exactly why (three distinct `SKIPPED` markers). An empty result is a claim about the world; a failure to look is a claim about the engine — the two never render the same.
3. **A walk over an untrusted denominator never renders a verdict.** The scout's changed-file list is reconciled against an independently-executed count; an empty diff or a zero-thread enumeration over a non-empty diff FAILS the walk rather than passing it.
4. **Zero-token where JS suffices.** Everything mechanical — card zipping, rule evaluation, chunking, contradiction detection, arming, telemetry assembly — is plain code between agent barriers. Tokens are spent only on judgment.
5. **Degrade loudly, partially, and in the safe direction.** A dead seat gets exactly one respawn (`retryAgent`); a dead slice keeps its survivors and names its hole; a failed telemetry section marks `degraded: true` and names itself while every other section still assembles.

## Modes and dispatch

Mode is computed in the `Configs` constructor, precedence top to bottom; construction throws if no selector is present:

| Selector arg | Mode | What runs |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `manifestPath` | manifest-verify | claimExtractor mines the manifest → claim panel → consistencyJudge |
| `claims[]` | verify | claim panel only (one verifier per claim × `votes`, or file-clustered batches past `soloThreshold`) |
| `goal` | investigate | lens probes → brainer-steered pursue/attack waves over a quote-pinned claim ledger → synthesiser |
| `reportPath` | walk (default) | the full thread walk + ledger spine + security fan-out described below |

## Walk-mode flow

`runWalk` in `src/engine.ts`. Phases separated by **barriers** (parallel agent batches); everything between barriers is zero-token JS.

```
computeGateArming(profile)          zero-token: arms/disarms gate machinery
        |
SCOUT (1, corrective retry ×1)      threads + sensor jobs + gate files + auth rule
        |                           misreconciled() → retry → FAIL; empty diff → FAIL
computeArmedInvariants()            scout's semantic arming ∪ territory-glob fail-safe
        |
BARRIER 1 — Walk+Sense+Hunt        threadWalker × threads
                                    sliceSensor × jobs (≤18 fields each, ≤60 jobs)
                                    gateSweep × gate files (only when armed)
                                    securityAuditor × file clusters (≤12 files each)
                                    invariantHunter × armed invariants
        |
mergeSecurityResults()              intersection of categories; unswept files NAMED
zipCards() → computeAnomalies()     the ledger diff: R1–R8, plus R9-INV from hunters
computeVerdictContradictions()      same-file disagreements escalated by name
        |
BARRIER 2 — Judge                   anomalyJudge × chunks-of-6 (same-rule)
                                    territoryDigest × non-empty territories
                                    coverageCritic (when invariants supplied)
        |

        |                           AND confirmed R9-INV high+critical (both directions)
SECOND OPINION (opus, chunks of 4)  overrides marked [OVERRIDE …] / [RE-EXAMINED …, KILLED]
        |
FINAL JUDGE (1, opus)               authoritative verdict; reinstatements marked
        |

FOLD (1)                            writes ## Professor's Wave Review; returns ledger
```

## The seat roster

Nineteen seats, closed by the `Seat` union in `src/types/agents.ts` and mirrored one-to-one by `Configs.TIER`/`Configs.EFFORT`. Per-seat overrides ride `args.agents.<seat>.{model,effort}`; unknown seat or tier throws.

| Seat | Tier/effort | Cardinality | Duty |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| scout | sonnet/high | 1 (+1 retry) | enumerate threads, sensor jobs, gate files; extract the live auth rule |
| threadWalker | sonnet/high | per thread | confirm one flow reaches its terminal state |
| sliceSensor | haiku/medium | per job | extract producer/consumer/dbColumn/SDL cards |
| gateSweep | haiku/medium | per gate file | extract resolver guard-chain cards |
| securityAuditor | sonnet/xhigh | per file cluster | 8A–8K sweep of its slice, full set as context |
| invariantHunter | sonnet/high | per armed invariant | refute-first hunt of one registered invariant |
| coverageCritic | sonnet/high | 0–1 | name what the invariant hunt did NOT cover |
| anomalyJudge | sonnet/high | per 6-chunk | CONFIRMED / FALSE / UNPROVEN on flagged anomalies |
| territoryDigest | sonnet/high | per territory | the un-mechanizable smells rules cannot see |
| secondOpinion | opus/high | per 4-chunk | re-examine escalated verdicts, both directions |
| finalJudge | opus/high | 1 | rule the walk; reinstate wrong kills; name missed risks |
| fold | sonnet/high | 1 | merge everything into the written review |
| claimExtractor | sonnet/xhigh | 0–1 | mine a manifest's load-bearing claims |
| claimVerifier | sonnet/xhigh | per claim×vote | fact-check one claim (or a ≤4-claim batch) |
| consistencyJudge | sonnet/xhigh | 1 | cross-task conflicts, refuted premises, freeloaders |
| probe | sonnet/xhigh | per lane | pursue/attack one investigate lane, quote-pinned |
| brainer | opus/xhigh | per wave | steer the investigate ledger |
| claimAuditor | haiku/medium | per wave | grep every quote-pin; pass/fail mechanically |
| synthesiser | sonnet/xhigh | 1 | cited closing report, confidence floored by computed value |

## The rule engine

`computeAnomalies` (R1–R8, one sequential pass) plus `computeInvariantAnomalies` (R9-INV) in `src/rules.ts`; meanings in `ruleMeaning` (`src/constants.ts`). All zero-token — judges see only what these flag.

| Rule | Detects |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R1 orphan producer | produced field with zero production consumers (deadness-bar gated) |
| R2 phantom consumer | consumed field nothing produces, or an undeclared field read |
| R3 encoding mismatch | producer encoding vs consumer decode incompatible, incl. double-encode |
| R4 value-set mismatch | compared literals no producer emits (casing-only = critical) |
| R5 type drift | hand-typed base type ≠ generated/SDL base type |
| R6 gate outlier | fenced+unfenced gates on one resource class; owner role with client id and no ownership fence |
| R7 unfenced ID flow | client-supplied id reaches data access with neither org nor ownership fence |
| R8 dangling reference | a reference that resolves to nothing |
| R9-INV invariant violation | hunter-confirmed breach of a registered cross-cutting invariant |

## The project profile

Nothing project-specific is baked into this engine. `args.project` (validated in `Configs.parseProject`, shape `ProjectProfile` in `src/config.ts`) carries: `repoRoot`, `authDoc`, `authRuleFallback`, `authRuleMustContain`, `roles{owner,elevated}`, `resourceClasses`, `fencedResourceClasses`, `fenceLabels{org,ownership}`, `gateResolverPattern`, `gateSurfacePattern`, `deadnessSurfaces`, `stakesLine`, `securityStakesLine`. Each consuming project writes its profile once in its `wave/walker.md` § Engine profile and passes it on every invocation.

`computeGateArming` arms the gate machinery only when the profile supplies both roles, a non-empty `fencedResourceClasses`, and both gate patterns compiling as regexes. Any miss disarms gate sweeps and R6/R7 for the whole walk — loudly:

- `SKIPPED — no project profile supplied` — profile absent or gate fields missing
- `SKIPPED — invalid gate pattern: <err>` — a pattern failed to compile
- `SKIPPED (diff-scoped)` — armed, but the diff touches no gate-relevant surface and `fullGateSweep` was not forced

All three render in the coverage summary, the ledger, and telemetry. The thread walk, security fan-out, and panel modes run fully regardless — the floor never regresses.

## Honesty mechanisms

The greppable inventory; each name is the function to read:

- `misreconciled` — scout's enumerated list vs its independently-executed count; one corrective retry, then FAIL.
- `computeVerdictContradictions` — same-file opposite verdicts escalated by name; no-file threads reported uncomparable, never silently agreeing.
- `computeArmedInvariants` — semantic arming ∪ deterministic territory-glob; a forgetful scout cannot silently disarm a hunt.
- `mergeSecurityResults` — categories intersected, unswept files named, `null` only when every slice died.
- `assembleDebugRecord` — five sections, each in its own try/catch; one failure degrades itself by name, never the record.
- `retryAgent` — exactly one respawn per dead seat, idempotency-asserting RESUME prefix, optional tier escalation.
- Investigate empty-ledger guard — live wave-0 probes that return zero auditable claims produce `FAILED`; no brainer or synthesiser can turn absence into a successful investigation.
- Escalation is symmetric — killed security/near-certain verdicts AND confirmed R9-INV verdicts both get an opus second opinion; overrides and reinstatements carry visible markers in the output.
- Verify-mode `claim.opus` — a per-claim escalation that cannot survive batching is logged when dropped, never silently lost.

## Build pipeline

The Workflow sandbox demands a single flat file beginning with `export const meta = {…pure literal…}` and ending in a top-level return — a shape esbuild cannot emit. So `build.js` is a **dependency-derived concatenating bundler**:

1. TS types are blanked in place with Node's `stripTypeScriptTypes` (never reflows code — `meta` stays byte-identical).
2. Module order is a stable topological DFS of the real import graph from `src/engine.ts`, edges sorted before recursion for determinism; `src/meta.ts` is pinned first.
3. Import/export statements are cut so all modules share one flat scope; only `meta` keeps its `export`.
4. Three loud guards: **reachability** (an orphan module fails the build by name), **cycles** (named), **post-sort order** (every dependency must precede its dependent — the actual invariant flat concatenation relies on, verified mechanically).
5. A deterministic `GENERATED FILE — DO NOT EDIT` banner lands immediately after `meta`'s closing brace. No timestamps, no hashes — builds are byte-reproducible.
6. `cross-workflow.config.js` binds the assembled program to one versioned harness IR, output schema, capability set, and per-runtime model map. The source SHA is computed from the fresh assembly.
7. The pinned `cross-workflow` library validates that contract, preserves the raw Claude result shape in `dist/cross-workflow/claude/workflow.js`, and compiles the same program to `dist/cross-workflow/codex/runner.mjs`. Target manifests carry the same workflow hash and assembled source SHA/provenance.
8. `equivalence.js` runs legacy and candidate bundles over the same real merge-SHA walk input with identical deterministic agent responses. Exact prompts/options, exact result, and verdict shape must match.
9. `npm run equivalence:headless` then runs both bundles in separate real headless Claude sessions over one byte-frozen Git-indexed/nonignored-untracked repository snapshot; ignored local state is outside the comparison. The transcript parser structurally binds exactly one Workflow tool use to its tool result, runtime task notification, run directory, and task output path. Promotion requires exact agent prompt/model/effort contracts, exact phase/agent/log topology, and the same grounded normalized terminal semantics. Stochastic reasoning and quote wording are hashed but are not required to be byte-identical. Both deterministic and live evidence must match the current bundle hashes before `activate.js candidate` atomically repoints `dist/active-workflow.js`; `npm run activate:legacy` is the rollback.

`verify.js` pins the legacy hash, rebuilds to a temp path, byte-diffs all four candidate targets, and rejects a candidate pointer whose deterministic equivalence, real-runtime smoke, or live headless old-vs-new evidence no longer matches the bundles. It runs as `pretest`, so compiler, source, or proof drift cannot pass the suite. `validate-bundle.js` checks each Claude artifact: parses as JS _and_ as the body of an `AsyncFunction` with exactly the harness globals; no surviving module system; `meta` is the literal first statement and a pure data literal (AST-walked); no nondeterminism (`Date.now`, `Math.random`, `process`, `fetch`, …); and a permanent **project-leak denylist** (terms built by string construction so the guard never trips itself) — a bundle naming the source project fails the build by the exact hit.

## Test suite

The test runner reports the current test/file count. The load-bearing suites are:

- `config.test.ts` — mode precedence, validation throws, all 19 seat tier/effort defaults, override plumbing.
- `engine.test.ts` — full walk pipeline, reconciliation, security fan-out, gate-conditional dispatch, **profile arming**, investigate loop, the invariant-registry feature end to end.
- `rules.test.ts` — R1–R8 cases, id numbering, sparse-input fallbacks, R9-INV synthesis.
- `prompts.test.ts` / `schemas.test.ts` — every seat's prompt and StructuredOutput schema pinned against transcribed source; conditional blocks are zero-byte when absent.
- `build.test.ts` — banner determinism, both cross-workflow targets sharing one hash, and the leak guard observed FAILING on a planted term (the guard's broken state is itself tested).
- `headless-equivalence.test.ts` — structural transcript/task-output binding, injected-marker and duplicate-call rejection, provider-prose normalization, prompt/model/effort drift, topology drift, and stale bundle-identity rejection for the live promotion gate.

## How to change the engine

1. Edit `src/` and its tests — never any file under `dist/`.
2. Run affected tests and `npm run typecheck` while iterating.
3. `npm run build` regenerates the side-by-side Claude target, Codex target, and manifests through the pinned library, then runs the Claude bundle validator. It never changes `dist/workflow.js`.
4. Run `equivalence.js` on the intended repository/merge SHA, run `npm run equivalence:headless` on the frozen live repository, then `npm run activate:candidate`; roll back with `npm run activate:legacy`.
5. `npm test` runs the all-target and active-proof stale guards before the suite.
6. Commit source, package pin, candidates, evidence, and the explicit pointer together in the Professor clone. Callers use `dist/active-workflow.js`, never a compiler-owned path.
7. Anything project-specific belongs in `args.project`, never in `src/`. The bundle leak guard enforces this mechanically at every build.
