// scout prompt — byte-identical to the source's inline construction (wave-walker.js lines 400-415) when charter is '' ; a non-empty charter appends the Professor-authored WALK CHARTER block (zero bytes otherwise). INVARIANT REGISTRY FEATURE (§ 2.1): a non-empty `invariants` list appends step 7 (zero bytes when empty/absent — the floor).
