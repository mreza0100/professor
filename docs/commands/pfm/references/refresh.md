# The Refresh Pass — Re-derive the Blueprint from Live Source

Executed inside `/pfm:release` (step 3). Re-derives the blueprint from the CURRENT `.claude/` and `CLAUDE.md` state. Edit files directly inside this repo's `templates/project/` tree — this repo IS the upstream clone.

**Scope (incremental):** `templates/refresh-map.json` maps every template to its live source(s) + the SHA-256 of each as of the last sync. `scripts/refresh-scope.sh scan` proves unchanged sources untouched — their templates are skipped; re-derive only CHANGED templates (plus files named by any bullet the `refresh-scope.sh ledgers` sweep collected, from this repo's ledger or a linked project's); UNMAPPED-LIVE files get a mapping ruling. `curated` templates have no live source and are never auto-derived. `refresh-scope.sh regen` re-baselines the hashes at release end.

**Update mechanism context:** Adopters install from a tagged blueprint. `pfm init` scaffolds project templates once and records per-file template pins in `.professor/baseline.json`; the local project files then own truth. `pfm update check` reports `UPDATED`, `NEW`, `GONE-UPSTREAM`, and `LOCAL-DELETED` mappings without writing. The session reviews each printed template diff, hand-applies wanted changes, and advances accepted pins. Machine-global symlinks update through the blueprint clone, and engine mirrors rebuild from local sources.

Cross-conversation context persists via **Epics** — initiative-level manifest files (`docs/epics/{name}/manifest.md`) with lifecycle tracking (PLANNING → IN_PROGRESS → SHIPPED).

## Three Tiers

| Tier                         | Description                                            | Ships                                                              | Gets parameterized                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A — Universal archetypes** | Personalities that work in any domain. Voice IS value. | Full character, structure, identity                                | Domain REFERENCES inside the character (Professor's PhDs, JC's stack traces)      |
| **B — Domain archetypes**    | Roles every project needs, content domain-shaped       | Archetype skeleton: identity, voice, charter, modes, doc structure | Regulation, knowledge domain, user persona, market segment — filled via interview |
| **C — Pure mechanics**       | Infrastructure agents and plumbing                     | Mechanics only — no character                                      | Tech-specific commands (test runner, package manager, build tool)                 |

### Tier assignments

**Tier A** — `Professor` (persona), `/jc`, `/pfm` (with its `update` and `release` subcommands), `/wave:builder`, `/dev`, `/git`, `/wave:orchestrator`, `/documenter`, `/save`
**Tier B** — `/officer` `{REGULATION}`, `/km` `{KNOWLEDGE_DOMAIN}`, `/pm` `{USER_PERSONA}`, `/mentor` `{MARKET_SEGMENT}`, `/marketer` `{CHANNEL_LANDSCAPE}`
**Tier C** — root agents (mono-planner, mono-architect, mono-documenter, gitter), scripts (worktree.sh, alloc-ports.sh, dev.sh), per-project agents (planner, architect, developer, qa, ui-ux, db-admin, devops, ai-engineer)

### Preservation (untouchable across tiers)

- Voice/tone of every Tier A character
- Archetype identity of Tier B commands
- Pipeline mechanics (planner → architect → developer → QA → gitter; worktree isolation; only-gitter-touches-git; QA gates pre+post merge; path variables)
- Discipline frame (zero-tolerance tests, mock policy, never-destructive-git, never-edit-main)

### Placeholders (project-specific → generic at refresh)

> Human copy — the executable copy is `scripts/placeholder-map.tsv`, applied by `scripts/genericize.sh` as the deterministic first pass on every re-derived template; edit both together. The LLM hand-judges structure only (roster collapsing, domain nouns, persona metaphors).

- `{PROJECT_NAME}` (and any former brand the repo was renamed from — a rename orphans the old name in the blueprint source, so scrub both), per-project directories → `{PROJECT_NAME}`, `{project-a}` etc.
- `Professor` → keep with "rename if you want" comment
- domain/user nouns (the project's subject matter, its users, its work units) → `{DOMAIN_NOUN}`, `{USER_NOUN}`
- the project's regulatory frame, jurisdiction, and legal-entity type → `{REGULATION}`, `{JURISDICTION}`, `{LEGAL_ENTITY_TYPE}`
- All tech specifics (transcription/AI providers, frameworks, ORMs, mobile/web stacks, API layers, databases, infra/cloud/hosting) → `{TECH_STACK_PLACEHOLDER}` per role
- Ports → `{PORT_A}`, `{PORT_B}`; package managers/test runners → `{PROJECT_PKG_MGR}`, `{PROJECT_TEST_RUNNER}`
- Blueprint self-references (`{BLUEPRINT_REPO}`, `{GH_USER}`, `{BLUEPRINT_CLONE_PATH}`) → resolved at install: a user with push access to the canonical repo targets it directly; everyone else targets their own fork

Character names (Professor, JC, etc.) ship as **default names with "rename if you want" instruction**. Concrete beats abstract.

## 1. Source files to mine

From the project repo:

- `CLAUDE.md` (root), `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/commands/*.md` (Tier A+B, including command directories like `.claude/commands/pfm/`, `.claude/commands/wave/`, `.claude/commands/audit/`, `.claude/commands/quality/`), `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (bundled + domain-hydrated only — see next bullet), `.claude/scripts/*.sh`
- **Source-fetched skills** (`360`, `ghostwriter`, `vision-factory`) — never vendor a `SKILL.md` copy for these; they live in their own canonical repos and a stale copy is the exact drift this avoids. Refresh maintains only `templates/project/skills/sources.json` (name → repo); SETUP clones each at install. `deep-rr` moved in-tree at `engines/deep-rr/` (ships with the blueprint clone, alongside Wave Walker) — no longer source-fetched; it updates when the blueprint clone updates, not independently.
- `docs/epics/` structure — Epics section of CLAUDE.md, manifest format, lifecycle, ownership rules
- `docs/agents/` scaffold — the hub `_index.md` format, the `standards.md` skeleton, and the cluster convention (structure only, NEVER doc content — every adopter's documentation body is their own)
- The source's per-project structure → mine it INTO the generic **roster PATTERN**: express each per-project file/section ONCE with `{project}` tokens (one representative project as the shape). NEVER bake the source's project count or role names into a template — the source's concrete roster (its N projects, those roles) is an install instance SETUP expands per entry, not template structure. A template must read correctly at roster size 1. See `PLACEHOLDERS.md` § "Project roster".

## 2. Tier-aware transformations

**Tier A:** KEEP voice/tone/structure/character/pipeline mechanics. REPLACE project identifiers + tech specifics with placeholders (the Professor's qualification is fixed prose — "15+ PhDs, one in whatever area the work touches" — a discipline roster found live genericizes to that line, never to slots). KEEP Epics section structure (manifest format, lifecycle, ownership rules) — it is domain-agnostic. **Persona voice is load-bearing — PARAMETERIZE a persona's generic sections (swap domain refs for placeholders); NEVER delete or trim them.** Worked voice examples and the Verdict examples ARE the value; mirror the live persona section-for-section, genericized — a thinned persona ships a weaker character. When a live persona carries a section the blueprint lacks, add it (genericized), never drop it.

**Tier B:** KEEP archetype skeleton. REPLACE domain content with named placeholders:

- **Officer:** `{REGULATION}`, `{REGULATION_FRAMEWORK_DOCS}`, `{ENFORCEMENT_AUTHORITY}`, `{DATA_SUBJECT_RIGHTS}`, `{INCIDENT_NOTIFICATION_TIMELINE}`
- **PM:** `{USER_PERSONA}`, `{PRODUCT_DOMAIN}`, `{USER_DAILY_WORKFLOW}`, `{USER_PAIN_POINTS}`
- **Mentor:** `{MARKET_SEGMENT}`, `{JURISDICTION}`, `{LEGAL_ENTITY_TYPE}`, `{FUNDING_LANDSCAPE}`, `{REGULATORY_BODIES}`
- **Marketer:** `{CHANNEL_LANDSCAPE}`, `{TARGET_LANGUAGE}`, `{COMPETITIVE_LANDSCAPE}`, `{INDUSTRY_CONFERENCES}`
- **KM:** `{KNOWLEDGE_DOMAIN}`, `{KNOWLEDGE_TAXONOMY}`, `{KNOWLEDGE_CONSUMERS}`, `{SOURCE_AUTHORITIES}`

**Tier C:** Strip tech specifics, keep structure, no character.

## 3. Output structure

```
professor/            ← this repo
├── README.md, INSTALL.md, CHANGELOG.md, VERSION, LICENSE
├── docs/
│   └── README.md, BLUEPRINT.md, SETUP.md, RELEASE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PLACEHOLDERS.md, references/
└── templates/
    ├── refresh-map.json
    ├── themes/       (curated statusline themes — no live source)
    ├── global/       (machine-global originals — agents/, commands/, skills/; `pfm install` symlinks them into engine registries; agent `.toml` twins are release-generated beside their originals and out of this map's scope)
    └── project/      (per-install templates — CLAUDE.md, agents/, commands/, skills/, scripts/, docs-agents/, docs-commands/, workflows/, epics/, codex/)
```

Rosters live in the tree, not here — `ls` the scope dir and read `refresh-map.json` for each file's live source or `curated` ruling. Two annotations that govern the refresh pass: source-fetched skills (each scope's `skills/sources.json`) are cloned from their canonical repos at install and never vendored; deep-rr ships in-tree at `engines/deep-rr/` (updates with the blueprint clone, not independently).

## 4. SETUP.md — interactive install interview

Exports an interview Claude conducts before touching files. Structure:

**Phase 1 — Interview** (8 questions in order):

1. Project identity (one sentence)
2. Character name & voice (keep Professor or rename?)
3. Project structure (single/monorepo, subproject count + purpose)
4. Tech stack per (sub)project (lang, framework, pkg mgr, test runner, build tool, DB, infra)
5. Professor's disciplines (10+ PhDs — what fits your domain?)
6. Tier B opt-ins: Officer (regulations?), KM (domain?), PM (persona?), Mentor (market+jurisdiction?), Marketer (channels+language?)
7. Sacred ground ("do no harm" in your domain)

**Phase 2 — Customization:** Rewrite every template replacing placeholders with interview answers. `/wave:builder` MUST be materialized from the actual project roster; delete planner/architect/developer/QA/db/devops blocks for missing projects and fail if any referenced agent path does not exist.

**Phase 2.5 — Skill Knowledge Hydration (domain-hydrated skills):**

Skills ship as **empty shells** when their content is project-specific — the structure (frontmatter, headings, report format) is universal, but the audit categories, detection patterns, file paths, and domain concerns must be researched per project.

| Skill                                                     | What's universal (ships)                                                                                 | What's project-specific (hydrated by RR)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analysis Protocol (in the fleet prompt, `templates/prompts/professor.md`) | Three-lens protocol (CS + domain + compliance), step sequence, report format, AI/ML audit mode structure | Domain lens content (replaces Psychology lens), compliance framework, cross-disciplinary intersections, AI/ML audit categories + anti-patterns (if project has an AI pipeline subproject) — the refresh interview hydrates this lens directly in the fleet prompt |
| `audit:code-hygiene`                                      | Category structure (ghost fields, dead code, stale deps, arch smells, type safety, naming, quality)      | Per-category detection patterns, file paths, known hotspots, linter coverage gaps, project-specific report examples                                                                                                                                                       |
| `audit:security`                                          | OWASP category structure (8A-8I), severity guide, report format                                          | Domain-specific PHI/data sensitivity rules, external API checks, framework-specific vulnerabilities, compliance-driven sub-categories                                                                                                                                     |

**Hydration process:**

1. For each domain-hydrated skill, check if the project has enough context from the interview (Phase 1) to run RR.
2. **If project is defined enough** → run `RR codebase` targeting the project's source to fill each command's knowledge base. The RR agent reads the actual code, identifies patterns, file paths, anti-patterns, and writes the domain-specific sections into the command's body (`.claude/commands/audit/{code-hygiene,security}.md`).
3. **If project is NOT defined enough** (new project, no code yet, or user skipped stack details) → write the skill with the universal structure but mark domain sections as empty:

```markdown
## Category N — {category name}

> **KNOWLEDGE BASE EMPTY** — This section needs project-specific detection patterns.
> Run the Professor's Analysis Protocol or `/audit:code-hygiene` after the codebase has enough code to analyze.
> The Professor will surface this gap: "Knowledge base is empty, waiting for user specification to fill it in."
```

4. **Professor behavior with empty commands:** When a domain-hydrated audit command is invoked and its knowledge base sections are empty, the Professor MUST NOT improvise. Instead: state which sections are empty, ask the user to either (a) provide the specification now, (b) point to code/docs to RR against, or (c) defer. The Professor stays in this loop until the command is filled — never proceeds with best-effort guessing on an empty knowledge base.

5. **Re-hydration:** User can re-run hydration at any time: "fill `/audit:security`" or "hydrate the audit commands" → triggers RR against current codebase to fill/update empty sections.

**Phase 2.6 — Host tooling probe (git-host bridge):** Check the install machine for `gh` and `glab` (`command -v`). For each present, write a one-file host command at `.claude/commands/h/{gh|glab}.md` (the `h:` host namespace) whose `description` records that the CLI is available on this host for {GitHub|GitLab} operations. It carries no procedure — it is the bridge that tells the Professor which CLI to drive: an adopter on GitLab forks + releases professor through `/h:glab`, a GitHub adopter through `/h:gh`, and `/pfm:release` and `/git` read this marker to target the right host. These host-local bridges are KEEP-LOCAL — excluded from the portable blueprint. Absent tools get no command. Then resolve the blueprint repo target: if the user has push access to the canonical repo, set `{BLUEPRINT_REPO}`/`{GH_USER}`/`{BLUEPRINT_CLONE_PATH}` to it; otherwise have them fork it and use the fork.

**Phase 3 — Smoke test:** Run `/dev status`, then one tiny `/jc` task and watch its project checks.

## 5. Public README

If the repo-root `README.md` is missing → write it from the template below. If it exists → diff against the template; overwrite only if the template changed.

> Expand this structural outline into the full README. Keep it terse, opinionated, pitch-forward.

# Professor — Multi-Agent Claude Code Pipeline

One-paragraph pitch: portable .claude/ that turns Claude Code into a self-disciplined engineering team with character. Personality is load-bearing.

## What you get
- Full cast (Professor, JC, Audit + Tier B opt-ins)
- Pipeline (planner→architect→developer→QA→gitter)
- Worktree isolation + port allocation
- Single git owner (gitter)
- Hotfix mode (/jc)
- Self-improvement at source (/pfm)
- Scaffold-and-own updates (`pfm update check` — reported template diffs, reviewed hand application, per-file pins)
- Epics — cross-conversation context persistence via manifest files (PLANNING → IN_PROGRESS → SHIPPED)
- Path conventions ($DOCS, $WORKTREE, $CDOCS)
- Documentation discipline (one agent writes permanent docs)

## Quick start
install pfm, cd your-project, `pfm init .`, claude → follow the printed SETUP.md install interview → customize → smoke test

## The cast — Tier A
Professor, /jc, /pfm, /wave:builder, /dev, /git, /wave:orchestrator, /documenter

## Tier B (opt-in)
/officer, /km, /pm, /mentor, /marketer

## The five load-bearing walls
1. Only gitter touches git
2. QA gates the merge (pre+post)
3. Path variables, not hardcoded
4. Worktree isolation per pipeline
5. Self-improvement at the source

## When to use it
✅ Multi-project monorepos, complex pipelines, teams losing work to half-finished branches, decision-audit matters, agents with voice
⚠️ Overkill for: 200-line scripts, throwaway prototypes, projects where main can break

## Origin & maintenance
Auto-regenerated from the live upstream repo. Maintained by @{GH_USER}. Issues/PRs welcome (open issue first for large changes).

## License
MIT
```

## 6. Process rules

- This repo is the ONE source of truth. Before editing: `git fetch origin && git pull --ff-only origin main`.
- Use `Edit` for surgical updates, `Write` for new files/full rewrites.
- Preserve manually-curated commentary unless it contradicts current state.
- Do NOT delete `INSTALL.md`, `LICENSE`, or hand-curated root files.

## 7. Report after the refresh pass

```
Refresh pass complete in templates/project/. {N} files updated, {M} unchanged.
