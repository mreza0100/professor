# RELEASE — How the blueprint ships and how adopters pull it

Two mechanisms ship on every tag: the portable blueprint tree (this repo, at `templates/`) and the compiled `pfm` CLI binaries (built from `pfm/`, attached to the GitHub Release). Both are versioned by the same git tag.

## Versioning

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), one `VERSION` file at the repo root as the source of truth, one annotated git tag `v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}` per release. Tags are immutable — never deleted or moved after push.

| Bump | When | Adopter impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PATCH** | Bug fixes, doc tweaks, non-interface mechanic changes | Review reported project-template diffs; machine-global links update with the clone |
| **MINOR** | New Tier B archetype, new mechanics command, new pipeline step | Review reported changes and adopt optional project files explicitly |
| **MAJOR** | Breaking rename, removed command, changed core convention | Full manual migration walkthrough; no silent project-file writes |

Magnitude for a multi-version update is the **largest single-release bump in the chain**, never the endpoint semver diff alone — one major release anywhere in the walked range makes the whole update major.

## Release notes layout

Per-version notes live in `releases/v{X.Y.Z}.md`, one file per version, each titled `# v{X.Y.Z} — {YYYY-MM-DD}` with bullets grouped under `## Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed/Breaking/Migration`. `CHANGELOG.md` is a **slim index only** — one line per release (`- [v{X.Y.Z}](releases/v{X.Y.Z}.md) — {summary}`), prepended on every release. Never write full notes into `CHANGELOG.md` itself.

Bullets carry a category prefix and optional trailing tags, both read at update time:

- Prefix → `Tier A:` / `Tier B:` / `Mechanics:` / `Docs:` / `Scripts:`
- Trailing tag → `(safe-auto)`, `(breaking)`, `(opt-in)`, `(cost)` (env var/hook/permission/model-config changes — always routed to manual review regardless of prefix)

## Cutting a release

Maintainer command: `/pfm:release {patch|minor|major} "{summary}"`.

Run from inside the live source project against the local clone at `{BLUEPRINT_CLONE_PATH}` — the only working copy — targeting the public repo (`{BLUEPRINT_REPO}`, GH user `{GH_USER}`).

1. **Update-gate.** `baseline-sync.sh` checks the clone isn't behind published tags for reasons other than this repo's own prior publish round-trip; a genuine peer-content gap forces updating the install from the clone first.
2. **Sync the clone** — `git fetch && git pull --ff-only origin main` (stop on failure).
3. **Refresh pass**, scoped by `templates/refresh-map.json`: `refresh-scope.sh scan` hashes every live source — unchanged sources skip their templates, changed sources (plus anything named in `.professor/release.md`) get re-derived, unmapped live files get a mapping ruling, `curated` templates are never auto-derived. Then execute `docs/commands/pfm/references/refresh.md` over that scope: `scripts/genericize.sh` runs the deterministic placeholder pass first (`scripts/placeholder-map.tsv`), hand-judgment covers structure only (roster collapsing, domain nouns, persona metaphors). `refresh-scope.sh regen` re-baselines the hashes afterward.
4. **Compute the new version** from `VERSION` + the bump type.
5. **Build changelog bullets** from `.professor/release.md` (already-final, copied verbatim — never re-authored). Bullets touching a `sources.json` skill ship to that skill's own public repo first, then get rewritten as a version-pointer bullet.
6. **Write `releases/v{X.Y.Z}.md`**, prepend the index line to `CHANGELOG.md`.
7. **Reconcile hand-curated docs** — `README.md` + `BLUEPRINT.md`'s cast/command/skill lists must match `templates/`; the README's "any repo, any stack" promise is the contract to keep, never downgrade.
8. `echo "{X.Y.Z}" > VERSION`.
9. **Gate, then ship:** `leak-check.sh` clean on the staged diff (brand names current+former, PII, machine-absolute home paths, secrets) → commit (`release: v{X.Y.Z} — {summary}`) → annotated tag `v{X.Y.Z}` → `git push origin main --follow-tags` (never force-push).
10. Clear `.professor/release.md`'s pending entries (keep the header), then report the tag URL, commit, source SHA, and changelog bullets.

**Never:** push secrets or project identifiers (current/former brand, PII, internal URLs, machine-absolute home paths), force-push, ship a Tier A character with empty placeholders, or auto-bump the README version without re-checking the templates it describes.

## What the tag push triggers

The workflow is `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

A `v*` tag push (or manual `workflow_dispatch`) runs on GitHub Actions:

1. **Build** — `pfm` for `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `darwin/arm64`, `darwin/amd64` (Go, `-trimpath`, `CGO_ENABLED=0`); each platform binary uploads as its own workflow artifact.
2. **Assemble** — downloads every platform binary, writes `SHA256SUMS`.
3. **Require authored notes** — fails the run if `releases/{tag}.md` doesn't exist; a tag with no hand-written release file cannot publish.
4. **Publish the GitHub Release** — attaches the `pfm_*` binaries + `SHA256SUMS`, with `releases/{tag}.md` as the release body verbatim (`generate_release_notes: false` — no auto-summary, the authored file is the only source of truth for the release body).

The authored-notes gate is why step 6 above (write `releases/v{X.Y.Z}.md` *before* tagging) is not optional — the tag push fails release assembly without it.

## Pulling an update (adopter)

State lives in `.professor/` inside the adopter's project: `VERSION` (installed version), `manifest.json` (user-owned interview record), `baseline.json` (pfm-owned local-to-template pins), `drift.md` (optional local customization notes), and `release.md` (framework changes queued to publish upstream — swept by the framework repo's release flow).

Run `pfm update` to advance the tagged clone, rebuild the binary, refresh machine-global links, and append the current project's report. Run `pfm update check` when only the read-only project report is wanted. For every `UPDATED` item, inspect the printed template diff, hand-apply what belongs in the local source, then run `pfm update pin <local>`. `NEW`, `GONE-UPSTREAM`, and `LOCAL-DELETED` print their own `pin --template` or `drop` actions. An install that predates `pfm init` runs `pfm update adopt [--at <ref>]` once to create its baseline; `pfm update ignore <template>...` keeps an unwanted template out of `NEW`. Generated engine mirrors remain whole-file compiler outputs; symlinked machine-global files update through their blueprint original. Source-fetched skills (`templates/project/skills/sources.json`) update from their own repos — compare the installed `version:` frontmatter against the skill repo's latest tag; never downgrade. Project files are never regenerated or merged during update.
