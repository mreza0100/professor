# What percentage of the web is blocked to bots and AI crawlers? (research, 2026-09-14)

**Answer in two sentences.** No measured figure supports "X% of the internet is blocked for bots" as a whole-web claim; the closest honest numbers are that **about 1 in 10 of the world's top 10,000 sites tells AI crawlers to stay out in robots.txt** (10.3%, HasData, July 2026; 8.92% under Cloudflare's managed block in June 2024), while **more than half of news publishers do** (56.4% robots.txt; only 54.2% will even serve a page to a bot that announces itself as GPTBot, versus 83.8% for a browser from the same IP). Whole-web "bot" percentages that circulate (53% of traffic is bots, 52.7% on Cloudflare) measure who is *sending* traffic, not who is *blocked*, and cannot be used for the stage line.

Method: 1 lead search + 5 Haiku diggers (round 1) + 2 verification diggers (round 2); three sources re-read from disk by the lead (HasData, Calvano, Consent in Crisis abstract). 7 dispatched / 7 received. Harvester `search` backend was down (502) for the lead's map step; WebSearch was the fallback.

Sources marked **[verified]** were read from the fetched artifact by the lead; the rest are relayed from a digger that fetched them.

### G. Adjacent "closed to a plain fetcher" populations

| Figure | Population | Date | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **50%** of scholarly articles closed/paywalled, 50% accessible in some form | 66M journal articles + conference papers, 2010–2024 | COKI dashboard, Aug 2026 | [open.coki.ac](https://open.coki.ac/) |
| 27.9% OA overall; 45% of 2015 articles OA | 66.56M Crossref-DOI articles | 2017 | [Piwowar et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4375) |
| Median page's rendered content exceeds raw HTML by **13.6%** (mobile) / 17.5% (desktop); 94.5% of pages served dynamically | HTTP Archive (~16M sites) | Nov 2024 | [Web Almanac SEO](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/seo), [Jamstack](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/jamstack) |
| 42% of JS-rendered content never indexed; 83% of React SPAs have critical content invisible without JS | 6,000 sites (method unstated) | Feb 2026 | [Onely](https://www.onely.com/blog/seo-tips-for-dynamic-content-and-dynamic-sites/) — weakly sourced |
| Googlebot rendered 100% of 37,000+ JS pages | Vercel/MERJ, Next.js-heavy sites | Apr 2024 | [Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/how-google-handles-javascript-throughout-the-indexing-process) |

Dropped as unverified: a round-1 digger reported "10.6% of the top 1 million block GPTBot / 9.1% ClaudeBot / 9.5% CCBot" attributed to Calvano; the lead read the article and none of those numbers appear in it. Also relayed but not verifiable here: Rutgers/Wharton "publishers blocking AI lost 23.1% of visits" (digger saw it only in a search snippet).

## (b) Which figures can carry "X% of the internet is blocked for bots"

**Can support a line of that shape (with the population named):**

- **10.3% of the top 10,000 sites** block at least one AI crawler in robots.txt (HasData, Jul 2026) — corroborated by Cloudflare's own 8.92% (managed block, top-10k, 2024) and 7.8% GPTBot (robots.txt, top-10k, Jul 2025), and by 19.1% on the narrower top-2,000. Honest form: "about one in ten of the top 10,000 sites".
- **56.4% of news publishers** (HasData) / 49.7% (Palewire, live) / 62–79% of top US-UK news sites (BuzzStream). Honest form: "more than half of news publishers".
- **~20% of websites are behind Cloudflare, which blocks AI crawlers by default for new domains since July 2025** (Cloudflare's own statements). Honest form: a fifth of the web now defaults to closed.
- **On the wire, an honest AI bot is served 54% of the time by publishers vs 84% for a browser** (HasData) — the strongest "blocked for bots specifically" number, because it is a paired-request measurement.
- **~5% of C4 tokens / 28% of its critical sources / 45% under ToS** (Consent in Crisis) — the only whole-corpus population, but it is 2024 data and "training corpus", not "the internet".

**Cannot support it:**

- **53% / 52.7% bot traffic** (Imperva, Cloudflare Radar): share of *requests made by bots*, says nothing about blocking. Using it as "half the web is blocked" is a category error.
- **22.2% hard block** (HasData): denominator is the 592 sites that *already* disallow GPTBot — a share of a share. Same for 39.5%, 5.0%, 2.3%.
- **8.56% of AI-bot requests get 403** (TechnologyChecker): a request-share on Cloudflare's network, not a site-share; and 4xx includes 404s (Vercel shows ~34% of AI-crawler fetches are simply bad URLs).
- **robots.txt disallow ≠ hard block**: 39.5% of sites that disallow GPTBot still serve it (HasData); Bytespider ignores robots.txt (IMC 2025). A robots.txt figure is "asked to stay out", not "blocked".
- **Top-N vs whole web**: every site-share figure is top-2k to top-10k; Cloudflare's only top-1M number is 2.98% (2024, managed rule only). Nothing measures the long tail's blocking rate.
- **Cloudflare's "20% of websites"** is a footprint, not a block rate; HasData finds only 26% of the top-10k behind Cloudflare and only 8.5% in scope of the Sept-2026 default block.
- **50% paywalled scholarship, 13.6% JS content gap**: adjacent populations ("closed to a plain fetcher"), not "blocked for bots".

## (c) The defensible claims

**Most defensible (one sentence, one citation):**
"About one in ten of the world's top 10,000 websites now tells AI crawlers to stay out in robots.txt — and among news publishers it is more than half." — HasData AI Crawler Block Index, July 2026 (10.3% and 56.4%), https://hasdata.com/blog/ai-crawler-block-index. Corroborated by Cloudflare's own top-10k figures (8.92% in 2024, 7.8% GPTBot in 2025).

**Punchier, still honest:**
"Announce yourself as an AI bot and nearly half of news sites shut the door: from the same IP, publishers served a browser 84% of the time and GPTBot 54%." — HasData, July 2026, paired-request measurement, same URL.

**Also usable:** "A fifth of the web sits behind Cloudflare, and since July 2025 Cloudflare blocks AI crawlers by default." — Cloudflare, 1 Jul 2025, https://blog.cloudflare.com/content-independence-day-no-ai-crawl-without-compensation/ and the press release above.

**Do not say:** "X% of the internet is blocked for bots" with any X — no measurement of that population exists in 2023–2026. "Half the web's traffic is bots" is true (Imperva 53%, Cloudflare 52.7%) but is a different sentence.

## Gaps

- **Harvester `search` failed (502 / "Retrieval failed")** for the lead's map query; WebSearch substituted. Diggers used WebFetch for most pages, so only three sources were re-read from disk.
- **Chris Humphrey "22.6% of top 10,000"** surfaced in the lead's search but no digger fetched it — unverified, listed only for completeness.
- **Cloudflare Radar AI Insights page** (https://radar.cloudflare.com/ai-insights) returned 403 to the digger; the live robots.txt disallow share for 2026 is unread. Cloudflare's "37% of top-10k domains have a robots.txt" (relayed) sits in tension with Calvano's 94% of 12M sites having one; not reconciled.
- **No whole-web (long-tail) blocking rate exists** in any source found; the nearest is Cloudflare's 2.98% of top-1M (2024, managed rule only).
- **Calvano per-bot percentages** live in charts the fetch did not render; only the "almost 21% of top 1,000 have GPTBot rules" sentence is verifiable, and it counts allow+disallow rules.
- **Rutgers/Wharton 23.1% traffic-loss figure** was seen only in a search snippet, never fetched.
- **JS-dependence**: no study measures what share of pages *require* JS for main content; the 13.6%/17.5% HTTP Archive content gap is a median-page delta, and the Onely 42%/83% figures lack a stated method.
- **Consent in Crisis** figures are 2023–2024; no 2025–2026 update of the token-share audit was found.
