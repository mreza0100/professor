# Cross-Project Build Pipeline

Run the full pipeline for: $ARGUMENTS

**All feature requests MUST go through this pipeline.** No cowboy coding.

---

## Step 0 — Name the pipeline, clean up stale dirs, and resolve paths

### 0a. Stale pipeline cleanup (MANDATORY pre-flight)

Before doing anything, check for abandoned pipeline directories in `docs/dev/tasks/` (excluding `archive/`). A pipeline directory is stale if it has NO corresponding active worktree in `.worktrees/`:

```bash
for dir in docs/dev/tasks/*/; do
  name=$(basename "$dir")
  [ "$name" = "archive" ] && continue
  if [ ! -d ".worktrees/$name" ]; then
    echo "STALE: $dir (no active worktree)"
  fi
done
```

For each stale directory:
- Has `7-post-merge-qa.md` → completed but not archived. Move to `docs/dev/tasks/archive/`.
- No completion marker → abandoned. Add `ABANDONED.md` and move to archive.
- Empty → `rmdir`.

### 0b. Name the pipeline

Choose a short kebab-case name. Verify uniqueness against `docs/dev/tasks/`, `docs/dev/tasks/archive/`, and `.worktrees/`:

```bash
ls docs/dev/tasks/archive/ docs/dev/tasks/ .worktrees/ 2>/dev/null | grep -x "{name}"
```

If exists, append `-v2` / `-v3` or pick a more specific name. Never reuse archived pipeline names.

### 0c. Resolve path variables

- `$PIPELINE` = `{name}`
- `$DOCS` = `docs/dev/tasks/{name}` — pipeline docs from repo root
- `$DOCS_REL` = `../../../docs/dev/tasks/{name}` — pipeline docs from worktree
- `$DOCS_POST` = `../docs/dev/tasks/{name}` — pipeline docs from project subdir (post-merge)
- `$WORKTREE` = `.worktrees/{name}` — pipeline worktree directory
- `$ARCHIVE` = `docs/dev/tasks/archive`
- `$PROJECTS` = list of affected projects (decided by mono-planner)
- Pipeline branch: `pipeline/{name}`

```bash
mkdir -p docs/dev/tasks/{name}
```

**Pass `$PIPELINE`, `$DOCS`, `$DOCS_REL`, `$WORKTREE` to every agent invocation.** Agents never hardcode paths.

---

## Step 1a — Parallel Codebase Analysis (child planners)

Invoke ALL child planners in parallel. Each writes `$DOCS/0-analysis-{project}.md`.

For each subproject in your repo, send one Agent call with `general-purpose` subagent type:

```
Agent(general-purpose, parallel): "You are the {PROJECT} planner. Read and follow {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/planner.md. Mode: ANALYSIS. Pipeline: $PIPELINE. Docs path: $DOCS. Feature request: $ARGUMENTS."
```

**Parallel:** all planners run simultaneously. Each writes its own analysis file. Wait for all to finish before Step 1b.

---

## Step 1b — mono-planner consolidation

```
Agent(mono-planner): "Pipeline: $PIPELINE. Docs path: $DOCS. Feature request: $ARGUMENTS."
```

Output: `$DOCS/1-plan.md`. Read it. The `Routing` section determines `$PROJECTS`.

---

## Step 2 — gitter SETUP

```
Agent(gitter): "Phase: SETUP. Pipeline: $PIPELINE. Docs: $DOCS."
```

Gitter runs `.claude/scripts/worktree.sh create $PIPELINE`, then writes `$DOCS/2-ports.md`.

---

## Step 3 — mono-architect (cross-project)

```
Agent(mono-architect): "Pipeline: $PIPELINE. Docs: $DOCS. Plan: $DOCS/1-plan.md."
```

Output: `$DOCS/3-architecture.md`.

---

## Step 4 — Per-project planner TASK mode (parallel)

For each project in `$PROJECTS`:

```
Agent(general-purpose, parallel): "You are the {PROJECT} planner. Read and follow {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/planner.md. Mode: TASK. Pipeline: $PIPELINE. Docs: $DOCS."
```

Each writes `$DOCS/4-tasks-{project}.md`.

---

## Step 5 — Per-project architects (parallel)

For each project in `$PROJECTS`:

```
Agent(general-purpose, parallel): "You are the {PROJECT} architect. Read and follow {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/architect.md. Pipeline: $PIPELINE. Docs: $DOCS."
```

Each writes `$DOCS/5-architecture-{project}.md`.

---

## Step 6 — Per-project developers (parallel)

For each project in `$PROJECTS`:

```
Agent(general-purpose, parallel): "You are the {PROJECT} developer. Read and follow {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/developer.md. Pipeline: $PIPELINE. Docs: $DOCS_REL. Worktree: $WORKTREE."
```

Each implements code in `$WORKTREE/{project-dir}` and writes `$DOCS/6-runbook-{project}.md`.

---

## Step 7 — Per-project QA (parallel, PRE-MERGE)

For each project in `$PROJECTS`:

```
Agent(general-purpose, parallel): "You are the {PROJECT} QA. Read and follow {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/qa.md. Mode: PRE-MERGE. Pipeline: $PIPELINE. Docs: $DOCS_REL. Worktree: $WORKTREE."
```

Each writes `$DOCS/7-qa-{project}.md`. If any QA reports blockers, route back to that project's developer for the fix loop. Loop until all QA reports green or budget exhausted (default: 3 iterations).

---

## Step 8 — gitter MERGE

```
Agent(gitter): "Phase: MERGE. Pipeline: $PIPELINE. Projects: $PROJECTS. Docs: $DOCS."
```

Gitter acquires merge locks, commits worktree changes, merges to main, removes worktree, releases locks.

---

## Step 9 — Per-project QA (parallel, POST-MERGE)

For each project in `$PROJECTS`:

```
Agent(general-purpose, parallel): "You are the {PROJECT} QA. Read and follow {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/qa.md. Mode: POST-MERGE. Pipeline: $PIPELINE. Docs: $DOCS_POST."
```

If a post-merge bug is reported: spawn a new `/jc` pipeline to fix it.

---

## Step 10 — mono-documenter

```
Agent(mono-documenter): "Pipeline: $PIPELINE. Docs: $DOCS. Archive: $ARCHIVE."
```

Updates permanent docs, archives the pipeline directory, writes `SUMMARY.md`.

---

## Step 11 — gitter DOCS-COMMIT

```
Agent(gitter): "Phase: DOCS-COMMIT. Pipeline: $PIPELINE. Summary: $ARCHIVE/$PIPELINE/SUMMARY.md."
```

Done. Report to user:

```
Pipeline {PIPELINE} complete.
- Branch merged: pipeline/{PIPELINE} → main ({merge-sha})
- Docs commit: {docs-sha}
- Permanent docs updated: {list}
- Archive: $ARCHIVE/{PIPELINE}/
```
